# [OpenWeather.org](https://openweathermap.org/)

As academics we get free access to the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/our-initiatives/student-initiative).

We get the benefits of the _Developer Plan_ for [current weather and forecasts](https://openweathermap.org/price#current) and the _Medium Plan_ for the [historical weather collection](https://openweathermap.org/price#history).

We will need to build our own data in Databricks using the API.
