## GraphQL APIs

- [Background](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/graphql/basics/what-is-graphql-introduction/)

> Facebook created GraphQL in 2012. They needed a better data-fetching approach that they could use across the entirety of the company’s products and services. They also wanted something that was understandable by developers, designers, as well as non-technical folk. After using it internally for some time, Facebook open-sourced GraphQL in 2015.
> 
> 1. GraphQL is a query language and a server runtime that typically runs over HTTP
> 2. It was designed to be more efficient, performant, and provide a better developer experience for working with data in a client-server architecture
> 3. GraphQL adoption has significantly grown since it was first open-sourced and it doesn’t look like it’s going anywhere soon.
