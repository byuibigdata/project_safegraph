Multiple industries leverage SafeGraph data to provide value and improve quality in their analytics pipelines ([see examples](https://www.safegraph.com/industries)). As a _Data as a Service (DaaS)_ company, they provide high quality and high volume data representing foot traffic at varied points of interest (POI). Their data are rich in their spatial and temporal detail.

Businesses that want to leverage this type of data need to see the data value. They also want to understand your specific skills at wrangling, feature creation, predictive modeling, and app development using Spark. In addition to your data science development skills, they want to understand your ability to generate value from data.

We need a final predictive model accessible by non-technical employees within the designed use case. Carefully documented guides should support this predictive model, data ingestions, data engineering, application development, and process implementation and installation. Your tool could address questions like the following?

- What foot traffic can I expect at my new gas station location that will open within the next year?
- Where should I place the next Taco Bell within city x or state y?
- I would like to introduce a new storage unit complex into a city in Idaho. Which city can absorb a new facility with the most negligible effect on unit prices?
- Based on the current brands in a given city, what is the next best brand that a franchiser should open?
- Can you predict a quarterly change in stock price based on the aggregated traffic at the retailer's brand?

Your submission will receive added weight if you exemplify incorporating additional data sets beyond those available from the SafeGraph API.
